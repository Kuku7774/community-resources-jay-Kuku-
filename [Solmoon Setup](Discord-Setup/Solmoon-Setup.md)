# ⚙️ Solmoon Discord Setup Guide

This is a summary of how I structured and managed the Solmoon Discord server from scratch — with security, engagement, and scalability in mind.

---

## 📂 1. Server Structure

### Main Categories:
- ✅ Welcome & Info  
  - `#start-here`, `#rules`, `#faq`, `#verify`
- 💬 Community  
  - `#general`, `#web3-talk`, `#off-topic`
- 🧩 Support & Feedback  
  - `#create-ticket`, `#report-issues`
- 📢 Announcements  
  - `#official-news`, `#giveaways`, `#partnerships`
- 👑 Team & Mod Zone (Private)  
  - `#mod-chat`, `#internal-updates`

---

## 🤖 2. Bot Setup

### Used Bots:
- Wick → Verification & anti-raid  
- MEE6 → Level roles, auto-messages  
- GiveawayBot → For campaigns  
- Carl-bot → Logs + role assignment  
- Zealy/Guild → Quest + role linking

### Role Structure:
- `@Unverified` (default for new joins)  
- `@Verified` (after captcha/pass check)  
- `@OG`, `@Alpha`, `@Community Hero` (based on XP / campaign)

---

## 🛠️ 3. Security Steps

- Wick's captcha verification for all new joins  
- Raid mode on during heavy X post promos  
- Removed @everyone mentions from announcements  
- Separate `#verify` page with lock + DM disable tip

---

## 🔄 4. Ongoing Management

- Weekly cleanup of inactive channels  
- Monthly XP reset + OG leaderboard update  
- Giveaway rotations every 10–14 days  
- Used threads for support replies to reduce clutter

---

## 📈 Result

- 2.5x boost in engagement after setup  
- Raid attempts blocked within seconds  
- Community clearly understood rules & support flow  
- Reusable server model for other Web3 projects
